# Typescript Project with jQuery
This repository contains a typescript project setup with jQuery. When I first learned how to setup jQuery along with Typescript, I had to scrape through a ton of guides, examples, and videos on the internet. I am hoping this can help others that have a need to use ts and jQuery together. Enjoy!

Starter Project Contains:
* Typescript
* jQuery
* LESS
* Webpack

## Quick Start
1. Run ``npm install``
2. Run ``npm start`` to preview changes on ``http://localhost:8080/``
